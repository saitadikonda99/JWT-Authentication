# JWT-Authentication
JWT, or JSON Web Token, is a compact way to transmit information between parties. It consists of three parts: a header specifying the type and signing algorithm, a payload with data, and a signature to verify the sender. It's commonly used for authentication and securely exchanging information in web development.
